# VSCP Helper Library Bindings {#vscp_helper_library_bindings}

The VSCP helper library currently have bindings for

* [c/c++](https://github.com/grodansparadis/vscp-helper-lib)
* [Python](https://github.com/grodansparadis/pyvscphelper)
* [node.js](https://github.com/grodansparadis/node-vscp-helper)

It should be quite easy to make bindings also for other platforms.
